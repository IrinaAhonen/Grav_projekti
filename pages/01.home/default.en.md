# <a name="meditaatio" /> Meditation is cool!

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear.

Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown.

**Weekly meetings <br>
Mondays at 18.00-20.00 <br>
Adress: Meditaatiokellari (Meritullinkatu 11 B) **

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

**Stydy circle<br>
Mondays 17:30-18:00 (before weekly meetings) <br>
Adress: Meditaatiokellari (Meritullinkatu 11 B)**

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear.
